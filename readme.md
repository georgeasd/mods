## About Mods

Mods is a web application framework with focus on simplicity, modularity, powerful features and performance. Re-usable code would always stay at one place and thus it would be easy to maintain the code because you would have to make the changes at a single place only. To re-use this piece of code, all you have to do is call the function wherever required. Mods attempts to take the pain out of development by providing modular based architecture and doing the heavy lifting.

Mods is based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) by Taylor Otwell.

- **Laravel**: 5.4.*
- **PHP**: 5.6+ and 7
- **Author**: Sunel (sunelbe@gmail.com)

Mods Provides few out of the box modules, such as:

- [Theming](https://mods.thehackerleague.com/docs/theme).
